          </h3>

            Ever since I was a kid, Iâ€™ve been captivated by the sounds and mysteries of computersâ€”the whirr of a CD-ROM, the tick of a hard drive, the unforgettable buzz of a dial-up modem. While being a pilot remains a dream, becoming a computer and programming expert is the part that came true.
            <br /><br />
            Today, Iâ€™m passionate about building secure, reliable, and impactful solutions that keep systems running smoothly. I thrive in fast-paced environments where I can tackle challenging issues, from complex Kubernetes pod crashes to cross-region connectivity puzzles. I enjoy working hands-on with detailed logging and advanced monitoring to ensure everything runs seamlessly and users get the best experience possible.
            <br /><br />
            My strengths include designing end-to-end automation with integrated linting, security scans, and workflow optimization. I take pride in quickly diagnosing and resolving production incidents, and Iâ€™m constantly looking for new ways to innovate and grow.
            <br /><br />
            If youâ€™re interested in learning more about my work, collaborating, or just want to talk tech, feel free to connectâ€”Iâ€™m always open to new ideas and great conversations!
